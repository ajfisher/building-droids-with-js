Notes:
My initial interest in computing came from an interest in electronics.
But the reality was that for a kid growing up in the late 80s, building serious
hardware was prohibitively expensive and required facilities that most kids
didn't have access to in those days. As a result, as a teen I moved to software
where you could get better results much faster - which is a particularly good
pay off for the attention span of a teenager.

And this situation remained the case until recently.

## Hardware is becoming more like software

[Phil Farugia](#)

Notes:
Until this came along - this is an arduino and it has changed the way
we think about hardware. Hardware was no longer expensive - these were
designed at the time to be less than 20 euros and the designs were open
sourced, meaning anyone could make their own versions. Today you can get them for
$5. Sophisticated hardware suddenly became accessible to students, artists, kids and
web people. And with them, these communities brought ideas around design,
user experience, art and software and architectural principles.

Now, over the last few years, some great work has been done in the
node community getting JS to work with hardware like this.

Notes:

During the same period - wireless connectivity prices have dropped
spectacularly as well. This has led to the rise of numerous things becoming connected
devices. Now whilst we have things like Nest thermostats providing
worthy useful functions.

---

## The Internet of awful things

![](/images/smart_tramp.png)<!-- .element style="width: 65%" -->

Notes:

We also have some questionable uses of the technology as well that really don't
add much in the way of value. This is a good example but also things like
Internet enabled toilets and pregnancy testers rate pretty highly on my list too.

Regardless though, there are going to be a lot of connected products being
made and once the useful categories are discovered there's a lot of opportunity
to be involved in this space.

Notes:

So today I want to talk to you about how you can start working with hardware -
initially at least using JavaScript. The aim is that you can go and start
tinkering and learning about this stuff and exploring the hardware world and
develop the skills that enable you to be at the table - not necessarily to be
the hardware engineer but to have an understanding of the hardware so you can
design great software to work with it.

## TODO

1. Why use JS for robotics?
2. Introduction to the NodeBots stack
3. Applications and examples

Notes:
So to do this, we'll consider:

What makes JS good for hardware

We'll then look at the hardware stack

Then I'll show some examples and some demos

So let's get cracking

## Why use javascript for robotics?

[JohnGreenaway](https://www.flickr.com/photos/johngreenaway/3356358479/)

Notes:

So let's start by looking at what makes JS and hardware really powerful together.

---

### JavaScript is too dynamic to be precise...

![](/images/mars1.png)<br/>
![](/images/mars2.png)

Notes:

At the start of the JS hardware movement a few years ago this tweet came onto
my feed.

The implication was that JS is so quirky and incapable of precision that
not only would a rocket crash into a planet, but it would crash into Venus
instead of Mars.

It's easy to pick on JS because the language is so dynamic that you can do
crazy things with it and yet we forget that statically typed and memory mapped
languages have caused significant security and software bugs over the years also.

---

### Real hardware engineers use C...

![](images/tessel.jpg)
![](images/micro-python.jpg)

Notes:

In the hardware world, C has ruled for 30 years so there's an assumption that
all hardware must use C. This is still mostly the case - especially with older
or cheaper chips. However the next generation of medium cost chips are more or
less here now that can run python and JavaScript natively on the board.

Let me ask a question:

How many of you know how to program in C?

Okay - so how many of you LOVE to program in C? None. No one loves programming
in C even if you're capable of it - it takes a long time to do not a lot and 
let's face it, trying to build web applications in C produces some of the most
awful web interfaces known to man.

---

### Web apps designed by hardware engineers
<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/router.jpg" -->

Notes:

This is what happens when you get a hardware engineer to design web applications.
This is recent as well - it came off my router at home.

---

### Why use JS and hardware?

[Oskay](http://www.flickr.com/photos/oskay/2310115216/)

Notes:

So why use JavaScript compared to some other high level language.

For me it's mainly because of JS' event handling and ptototypical inheritance.

---

### EventEmitter

![](images/nodebotanist_tweet.png)

Twitter: <!-- .element: class="attribution" -->
[@nodebotanist](http://twitter.com/nodebotanist)

Notes:

JavaScript has incredible event handling. We tend to take this for granted, as
web developers. If you work in NodeJS then you have probably worked with EventEmitter
and it's just amazing at allowing different parts of your application to talk to
each other in a relatively decoupled way.

This becomes astonishingly useful in the hardware world.

---

### The real world is all events
<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/door.jpg" -->

[txmx 2](https://www.flickr.com/photos/txmx-2/8535263071)

Notes:

When you're designing something to work in the real world thinking about events
makes so much sense that it makes your code very clean, modular and responsive.

Say you are designing a door entry system with a card. In JS we simply define
an event listener and wait for the card swipe to occur with the detals of the
card and then handle it. We can do the same thing in C but we write a lot of
code, have to use interrupt handlers and make sure we suspend the system state
properly or our door will crash.

JS is designed to just work with this sort of behaviour.

---

### Prototypes provide flexibility

```
var right_motor = new Motor({controller: 'PCA34567'});

right_motor.start();

var left_motor = new Motor({controller: 'I2C'});

left_motor.start = function(speed) {
    // eg normalise speed to controller expected values
    this.speed = (speed/100) * 1024 ;
};

left_motor.start();

```

Notes:

The other feature that is awesome for hardware is JS's prototypical inheritance.

Being able to define the shape of an api for an object in hardware and then
dynamically bring in a controller to deal with specific implementation details allows
us to work with many different types of hardware effortlessly such as these
motors here.

As an end user of the API you don't need to worry about what happens down low,
You can just write code to start the motor turning and pass a speed in.

But also it means if you have a specific case you need to address, you can
extend or redefine the object with your own controller say like mapping a
percentage speed value to a specific bit range that the motor expects.

This makes prototyping much much faster but it also means we can create common
structures for components in a way that's almost impossible in C.

### JS ‚ù§ Robotics

[hiperbolica](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hiperbolica/3414999010)

Notes:

So Javascript is well suited I think to working with hardware, so let's take a
look at what the hardware stack looks like.

---

## The NodeBots stack

![](/images/logo.png)

Notes:

Nodebots is what we call JavaScript working with Hardware through NodeJS.
The core of NodeBots is really transport protocols to allow us to talk over
USB, wireless or serial connections.

Then, wrapped around this we have a framework called Johnny Five.

---

## Johnny Five
<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/rick.jpg" -->

(C)<!-- .element: class="attribution" -->
[Joanne Daudier](https://twitter.com/jdaudier)

Notes:

Johnny Five abstracts hardware into components that behave the same way regardless
of the controller for the hardware and the board that you're using it on.
This allows you to concentrate on building great things and allows you to
prototype very rapidly.

Johnny Five was started by this guy - Rick Waldron, and there's now many
members of the core team who work on this from all around the world.

---

### The stack

* Controller board (sensors and actuators)
* IO Plugin (communications protocol)
* Johnny Five / NodeJS (application logic)
* WS/HTTP (networking and security protocols)
* Clients (UI, input, visualisation)

Notes:

So this is what the typical JS hardware stack looks like.

We have a board which could have sensors and actuators. Most controller boards
can't run JS yet so we normally need to put some firmware on them to do what we want.

This talks via a communications protocol to what is called an IO Plugin. IO
plugins are a Johnny Five idea that tries to get hardware to behave in consistent
ways via a protocol

Johnny Five gives us abstraction on components so we can turn motors and LEDs into
JavaScript objects and interact with them consistently.

As a side effect we get all of NodeJS as well so that means we can start doing
interesting things like linking up with our normal web protocols.
And then finally we can add clients for things like UI and what not.

---

### Common implementation

* Controller board (Arduino)
* IO Plugin (Firmata over USB)
* Johnny Five / NodeJS (application logic)
* WS/HTTP (networking and security protocols)
* Clients (UI, input, visualisation)

Notes:

So in practice this is what a specific implementation of this stack looks like.
You can see we've got an arduino board in this case and the IO Plugin is
a firmware called Firmata which provides us the interface to the board for Johnny
Five. This is about the most basic and most common stack you can use but you can
see that the bit we are concerned about - being the bit in the middle pretty
much stays the same all the time.

---

## NodeBots hardware

* Servos, Motors, ESCs, Stepper motors
* Accelerometers, Gyroscopes, Compasses, IMUs
* Temperature, Proxitimity, Pressure sensors
* LEDs, NeoPixels, Pixel matrices
* Switches, Joysticks, Buttons
* LCDs

Notes:

In terms of hardware - there is a lot covered in Johnny Five and more core
components are still being added. The intent is to have the majority of the
most common electronics components you're likely to come across available in
the framework and then you can use then to compose bigger objects that then
represent your thing that you're making.

---

### Installation

* npm install nodebots-interchange (firmware package manager)
* Flash board with protocol (eg Standard Firmata)
* npm install johnny-five
* Write code
* ...
* Make an awesome robot

Notes:

So to get up and running, it's just npm install johnny-five and a tool called
interchange which is like a package manager for firmware. This will install the
IO protocol you need for the board which for an Arduino is Firmata and then
you get stuck into writing code.

---

With all this power, what sort of things can you build? Well I'm going to show
you some examples of some fun things people have made and show you some code
as well.

Notes:

This skirt, made by Kassandra Perch is fully contained running javascript on a
little board embedded into it. It has an accelerometer and as you move around
the LEDs inside it light up different colour. So you can even use JavaScript in
your clothing!!

Here is an example by Adrian Catalan of using nodeJS to make a physical game
which many of you will probably recognise.

Notes:

Donovan Buck has done a lot of work on making sophisticated animation control
in nodebots with a library to solve inverse kinematics problems. Here you
can see he has attached a 6-leg robot to a leap motion for hand control and it
responds very very fast to his movement.

[geekscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9f8IfHbXo4)

Notes:

Some work by Andy Gelme and Andy Kitchens in Melbourne have been using
Tensorflow to teach a robot how to detect roads and then layering that with
NodeBots controller code to get it to drive around and follow the road.

---

### Hello World
<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/hello_world.jpg" -->

[Daniel Novta](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vanf/5210360116)

Notes:

So now you've seen some examples, let's see a demonstration. With hardware you
most of the time don't have a screen. So a hello world example is just getting
an LED to blink on and off.

---

### Circuit

![Simple LED circuit](/images/LED.png)

Notes:

We will use an arduino and we're just going to plug an LED into this pin 10 here.
The arduino will run firmata like I described before and then we'll use Johnny
Five to control it all.

---

### Hardware hello world

```
var five = require("johnny-five");

var board = five.Board({port: process.argv[2]});

board.on("ready", function() {

    var led = new five.Led(10);
    led.blink(500);

});
```

Notes:

So here's the code to make this work. You can see here that I have the board
connect and then when it is ready the callback fires and I have a simple call to
blink every 500ms. This is a convenience method which just sets a timer interval
and then calls it.

---

### Demonstration
<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/blinkled.gif" -->

Image of live demonstration. Code: <!-- .element: class="attribution" -->
[ led.js](/code/led.js)

Notes:

So let's see that work.

Easy right - that is like the blink tag in hardware!!

---

### Web page LED

```
var five = require("johnny-five");

if (process.argv[2] == null) {
    console.log("Please supply a device to connect to");
    process.exit();
}

// web server elements
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var http = require('http');
var server = http.createServer(app);
var board;

// Set up the application server
app.configure(function() {
    app.set('port', 8001);
    app.use(app.router);
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
});

server.listen(app.get('port'));

// Set up Socket IO
var io = require('socket.io').listen(server);
io.set('log level', 1);

console.log("MESSAGE: Web server now listening");

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
    response.sendfile(__dirname + '/public/index.html');
});

io.sockets.on("connection", function(socket) {

    if (board.ready) {
        socket.emit("connect_ack", {msg: "Welcome ", state: "ONLINE"});
    } else {
        socket.emit("connect_ack", {msg: "Welcome", state: "NOPINS"});
    }

    socket.on("toggle", function(data) {
        // use the control mech to switch the LED on or off
        board.digitalWrite(pin, data.state);
    });
});

// SET up the arduino and firmata
var pin = 10; // led pin to turn on.
board = new five.Board(process.argv[2], function(err) {
    if (err){
        console.log(err);
        process.exit();
    }
    console.log("Control via your browser now");
});
```

Notes:

So that's great but what about if you want something connected to the browser?

We'll use the same circuit but this time we can use express to make a web page.
You can see here the code is mostly just setting up page routes and then we
use web sockets to send a message when the button is clicked.

After that it's mostly just the same code as before. Connect to the board and
make it respond to a message.

---

### Web connected light
<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/webled.gif" -->

Image of live demonstration. Code: <!-- .element: class="attribution" -->
[ webled.js](/code/led.js)


Notes:

So here it is working - as I click the button the LED turns on and off. So that's
a button that can turn a physical light on and off embedded into a presentation
all with just a little bit of javascript and a couple of bits of hardware.

I can hear many of your brains starting to think about the opportunities for
things like home automation and what not now.

### Connected devices
<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/little_printer.jpg" -->

(C)  <!-- .element: class="attribution" -->
[Berg London](#)

Notes:

So on that note, what about going the other way, how about we have a sensor
in the wild, maybe it's a wireless temperature sensor like this one here I've
got on the table. And perhaps we want to grab that data to log it or in fact
maybe we use the temperature to determine whether we should turn on a watering
system for some plants or turn on the heating or something like that.

---

### Temperature recorder
<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/esp8266.jpg" -->

(CC)  <!-- .element: class="attribution" -->
[kernel32.dll](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kernel32dll/17163885215/)

Notes:

In this case, we're going to use one of these little wifi modules I mentioned
earlier which are about $5 each.

Unfortunately they can't run JS just yet but there's an effort to get a very
lightweight JS engine running on them. Regardless though, we'll do a similar
thing as we did with the arduino and run a firmware on them which in this case
just takes temperature readings and then spits it out over a protocol called
MQTT.

If you haven't seen MQTT before it's really interesting, it's one of the original
PubSub protocols and it has a lot of cool features like quality of service on
messaging and things like that and there's MQTT servers writting in many
languages. Including, NodeJS. Most notably, the main Node one I use called MOSCA
also happens to talk websockets, so you can bridge your devices talking MQTT
through to the browser over standard websockets too.

---

### Temperature sensor

```
var mosca = require('mosca');

var moscaSettings = {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 1883,
    http: {
        port: 8002,
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        static: './mqtt/',
        bundle: true,
    },
};

var server = new mosca.Server(moscaSettings);
server.on('ready', () => {
    console.log("MQTT server is ready on port %s", moscaSettings.port);
    console.log("HTTP Server is ready on pott %s", moscaSettings.http.port);
});

server.on('published', (packet, client) => {

    // here we see if a client has published a tempfeed value and if
    // so we augment it with other data.
    if (client != undefined) {
        console.log('%s published a message', client.id, packet.payload.toString());

        if (packet.topic == "tempfeed") {
            let value = packet.payload.toString();
            let time = (new Date()).getTime() / 1000;
            let dp = {
                sensor_id: client.id,
                time: time,
                y: value,
            };
            server.publish({
                topic: 'tempfeed/data',
                payload: JSON.stringify(dp)
            });
        }
    }
});

```


Notes:

So this is what that looks like in terms of code. It's pretty simple
we set up the mosca server to listen on an MQTT port and we also get it
to be able to serve HTTP which will deal with our websockets interface.

The wireless module just sends a string to the MQTT topic which in this case
is a value with the current temperature. The server then
interprets this, gets the current time and republishes it with data around
the sensor ID etc to augment that. We do that on an aggregation topic and publish
to any clients that are listening.

---

### Temperature data

<iframe class="external" src="http://localhost:8002/" style="height: 400px;"></iframe>

Notes:

And this is what that looks like. I just have a handler subscribed to the
topic and it just grabs the data and plots it using a D3 timeseries chart.

So you can see very quickly we can start to grab some data from the environment
visualise that or potentially pass it into something else to take action.

You can imagine easily a situation where we pass this data to an arduino
to turn a fan on or off depending on if it's hot or cold for example and that
would be easy to do.

### mBot

[ajfisher](http://twitter.com/ajfisher)

Notes:

This final demonstration is a little more complex. This is an mBot by a company
called MakeBlock.

They have many features, including motors, sensors and can use bluetooth and wifi too.

---

### mBot drive code

```
var five = require("johnny-five");

var max_speed_l = 150;
var max_speed_r = 140;

// set up the input
var stdin = process.openStdin();
require('tty').setRawMode(true);

var board = new five.Board({port: process.argv[2]});

var l_motor = r_motor = null;

board.on("ready", function(err) {

    if (err){
        console.log(err);
        return;
    }
    l_motor = new five.Motor({pins: {pwm: 6, dir: 7}});
    r_motor = new five.Motor({pins: {pwm: 5, dir: 4}});

    console.info("Board connected. Robot set up. LRUD to control");

});

stdin.on('keypress', function(chunk, key) {
	// process the keypresses

	if (key) {
		switch (key.name) {
			case "up":
                l_motor.reverse(max_speed_l);
                r_motor.forward(max_speed_r);
				break;
			case "down":
                r_motor.reverse(max_speed_r);
                l_motor.forward(max_speed_l);
				break;
			case "left":
                l_motor.forward(max_speed_l);
                r_motor.forward(max_speed_r);
				break;
			case "right":
                r_motor.reverse(max_speed_r);
                l_motor.reverse(max_speed_l);
				break;
			case "space":
                l_motor.stop();
                r_motor.stop();
				break;
		}
	}
});

```

Notes:

This code is a little long but mostly it creates a board and then uses the key
presses of a keyboard to then say to drive forwards, backwards, left and right
and turns the motors on and off in the right combinations to do this. Even
though there is some code it is very simple.

### Demonstration

Notes:

Let's see this drive. Hopefully this will work.

So this is just running over bluetooth and is controlled from javascript.
